# CSS for betas

Developers seem to be irrationally afraid of CSS, somehow. They try to offload the 'creative work' to 'creative people', like frontend developers or designers. That's unnecessary or even harmful, since you're depriving yourself of essential knowledge.

This repository aims to show you how to get the most results doing the least amount of styling work. You don't even have to do alpha-stuff, like talking about your feelings or holding a coloring pencil. 

## Requirements

Besideds a half-decent workstation and any OS, you'll need:
 
- [NPM][1].
- [Gulp][2].
- Your favorite IDE.
